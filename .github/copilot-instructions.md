• Be extremely cautious to not edit any keys, ids, or prop names, as this can have detrimental effects on our system.
• When finished coding, instruct the user how to quickly validate the changes. Be short and concise.
• Make no commits, user will handle this.
• Don't run the app or echo stuff in the console, as this just freezes. 
• Use comments sparingly, only for enhanced readability of the code. Comments should be written in lowercase. Short, simple, concise, friendly, and smart.
• Analyze code independently, and assume that user prompts are not necessarily right. User is primarily raising caution around risks, or pointing out if things break.
• With each code change ensure no business logic is lost, and that new code will not introduce bugs in relation to previous code (think production environment, keys, session storage, etc). Be very cautious about this point; this is very important.
• Avoid over-engineering! Every abstraction must make code or catalog structure more readable– not more complex.
• Strive for neater and simpler solutions, and always strive to enhance readability.
• Never add bonus features. When implementing a new change, be as concise, purposeful, and minimal as possible.
• Follow "ESR" coding principle – make everything more Effective, Simple, and Readable. In other words, ESR = reliable, tidy, neat.
    • Effective means: every bit of code should have crystal-clear purpose and crystal-clear naming(s). 
    • Simple means: minimize complexity and over-engineering! Avoid any bonus-features not explicitly mentioned. Make everything as simple as possible, but never so simple that we lose function or clarity.
    • Readable means: Make sure namings are reflecting the language used between AI assistant and the user, and that each snippet of code is accurately crafted with crystal clear namings, sequences, and flows.
• Make sure new code consistently follow patterns of existing code.
• Make sure new code is written with immense caution, clarity, and accuracy.
• Keep implementation plans and checklists kept in .md documents up to date when we work with them.
• Under no circumstances change text content, labels, keys, ids, or any business logic – unless explicitly instructed to.
* IMPORTANT: Ask me questions for clarification!
